Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel, ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying the last trimester of the bachelor's degree in Applied

Maths at Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) in Mexico City.

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning algorithms and their applications to solve

real problems. I still learning about it.

Here, you'll find some of my projects.
