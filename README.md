Hi, my name is Daniel,

I'm just graduated from the bachelor's degree in Applied

Maths at Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) in Mexico City, Mexico.

I’m interested in machine learning algorithms and their applications to solve

real problems, I'm interested in optimzation algortithms  and Data Analsys as well.

My last project is about time series forecasting using Bidrectional LSTM and 

Support Vector Regression for prediction of Dengue cases in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.

Here, you'll find some of my projects.
